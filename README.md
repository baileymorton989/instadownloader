# instadownloader

`instadownloader` is a Python library built on top of [instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io/) for scraping and storing Instagram photos to generate training datasets. It is currently designed so that a user can download "All Photos", the "Most Recent" Photo, or the Nth-Most Recent Photos, for both public and private users. For private users, the login credentials must be provided.

The script will save .jpg files for the photos downloaded, a pickle file with the raw .jpg files and a pickle file with the photos converted to numpy arrays. These photos will be stored in a folder with the following format : {username}_{today's date}, where today's date is in the format "MM_DD_YY".

## Installation

Installation is made simple by using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

```bash
pip install instadownloader
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example where the most recent photo is downloaded. A tkinter GUI will be used and all the user will need to do is choose whether the profile is public or private, provide the account name, a password if the account is private, as well the photo range that they desire. In this case, the photo range will be "Most Recent":

Example : 

```python
import instadownloader
import warnings

if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    #filter warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
    
    #get the credentials
    selector = instadownloader.TkinterSelector()
    profile_type = selector.profile_selector()
    username, password, photo_range = selector.photo_entry()
    
    #convert the photo range to integer if downloading range of photos
    try:
        photo_range = int(photo_range)
    except:
        print('Not an integer-based photo range')
        print('')
        
    #get credentials
    instadownloader = instadownloader.InstaDownloader(username, password, photo_range, profile_type)
    
    #start the session
    loader, profile = instadownloader.start_session()
    
    #download the images
    try:
        if photo_range  == 'All':
            images = instadownloader.get_all_images()
        elif photo_range == 'Most Recent':
            images = instadownloader.get_most_recent_image()
        elif type(photo_range) == int:
            images = images = instadownloader.get_image()
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    
    #empty the directory
    instadownloader.empty_directory()
    
    #save pickle file
    instadownloader.save_pickle_file()
```
